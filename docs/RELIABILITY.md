# Distributed reliability contract

This document defines what Redis does, what PostgreSQL does, and what the project does **not** claim.

## State ownership

PostgreSQL remains the durable source of truth. A pending action stores its kind/payload/status plus `created_at` and `expires_at`; executed mutations also have an action receipt keyed by the action ID. Orders, tickets and audit events are durable database state.

Redis is a coordination/control-plane dependency only. It stores short-lived action locks, TTL mirrors and rate-limit counters. Losing Redis keys must not rewrite the durable business meaning of an existing action.

## Confirmation expiry

`ACTION_CONFIRMATION_TTL_SECONDS` is persisted into PostgreSQL as an absolute `expires_at`. Redis receives a TTL mirror, but confirmation always checks the database deadline under the action lock. Therefore a Redis restart cannot extend or shorten the actual business confirmation window.

Expired actions transition to `EXPIRED` and cannot invoke the refund/return tool.

## Cross-replica action lock

Redis acquisition uses `SET key token NX PX lease_ms`. The token is random per acquisition. Release uses Lua:

```text
if GET(key) == token:
    DEL(key)
```

This prevents an old owner from deleting a newer lease after its own lease has expired.

The confirm flow re-reads the pending action after acquiring the lease before evaluating terminal state, expiry or executing a tool. A busy lease maps to HTTP 409 rather than waiting indefinitely inside the request.

## Mutation outage policy

With `RELIABILITY_FAIL_CLOSED_MUTATIONS=true`, a Redis failure while acquiring the coordination lock or refreshing the pre-mutation TTL aborts confirmation before the business side effect. This makes distributed coordination a required safety dependency for mutating requests in Redis deployment mode.

Cleanup/release failures after a successfully persisted mutation are audited as degradation and do not pretend the already committed side effect was rolled back.

## Rate limiting

The Redis rate limiter is a fixed-window counter implemented atomically with Lua (`INCR`, first-request `EXPIRE`, `TTL`). Scope and authenticated principal subject form the key. Exceeded limits return HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`.

`RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_OPEN=true` is deliberately independent from mutation fail-closed policy. If the limiter backend is unavailable, support/read traffic may continue; operators can set it false for stricter deployments.

## Local mode

`RELIABILITY_BACKEND=local` provides the same interface using process-local locks/counters. It is intended for deterministic local/unit testing and **does not coordinate multiple workers or replicas**.

## What this protects

The current design reduces the risk of two API replicas concurrently resolving the same pending action from the same stale state. It also makes confirmation expiry durable and rate limiting shared when Redis is enabled.

## What this does not prove

### No exactly-once claim

The Redis lease has a fixed TTL and no renewal/heartbeat. If a synchronous downstream mutation exceeds the lease duration, a second replica may eventually acquire it. For this reason:

- choose a lease longer than the expected mutation latency;
- propagate the stable action ID as the downstream idempotency key;
- keep the durable application receipt;
- require a real external payment/refund provider to honor idempotency;
- add lease renewal or a durable job/outbox workflow if mutations become long-running.

### No Redis HA claim

CI uses one standalone Redis 7.4 service. Sentinel, Cluster, failover, network-partition and replica-promotion semantics are not tested.

### Fixed-window rate limiting

The limiter is fixed-window, not sliding-window/token-bucket. It is adequate as a bounded engineering baseline but has the usual boundary burst behavior.

## Current verification

The v0.5 successful CI run verifies unit-level expiry/no-side-effect, lock-busy behavior, fail-closed mutation behavior and 429/Retry-After. A separate real-Redis integration verifies cross-coordinator lock exclusion/release, Redis TTL presence and shared atomic rate-limit state.

Future reliability work should be driven by observed requirements: lease renewal/outbox for longer asynchronous operations, Redis HA testing when deployment topology requires it, and observability/load tests before tuning limiter algorithms.
